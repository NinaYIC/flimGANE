# *flimGANE*
<u>**f**</u>luorescence **l**ifetime **im**aging method based on **G**enerative **A**dversarial **N**etwork **E**stimation

This code implements the model from the paper "[Generative adversarial network enables rapid and robust fluorescence lifetime image analysis in live cells](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02938-w)". It is a new deep learning-based fluorescence lifetime estimation method based on Generative Adversarial Network framework. *flimGANE* can rapidly generate accurate and high-quality FLIM images even in the photon-starved conditions. We demonstrated our model is not only faster but also provide more accurate analysis in barcode identification, cellular structure visualization, FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer characterization, and metabolic state analysis. With its advantages in speed and reliability, *flimGANE* is particularly useful in fundamental biological research and clinical applications, where ultrafast analysis is critical.
